          <h2>Why do we need another library?</h2>
          <p>
            While there are a couple of libraries out there, I was not very
            satisfied with any of them. First of all, I could not find any that
            supports both self hosted videos as well as YouTube hosted ones. Second,
            most of them rely on jQuery. And third, they were not easy to pick
            up for beginners.

          <h2>Documentation</h2>
          <p>
            Most mobile devices do not support auto-playback of videos,
            in which case the video will be initialized in the paused state.
            For video to start playing, it requires a user interaction, like
            clicking on the element. You could use API to listen to a click
            event and trigger the video playback.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem arises when you want to detect which devices can
            autoplay videos. A foolish approach is detecting touch screens, but
            not only is it really hard, it's also not precise because a lot of
            laptops have touch screens. It is left up to the developer to
            implement detection that best suits his project. For this demo, I
            am using <a href="https://modernizr.com/download/?videoautoplay">Modernizr</a>
            autoplay detection that is really hacky (and quite big), but seems
            to work pretty reliably.
          </p>
          <p>
            On devices you don't want to display videos on, I suggest only
            providing poster and leaving out the <code>src</code> to stop the video from
            unnecessary loading.
          </p>

          <h3>Include the library before your own javascript:</h3>
<pre><code>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;js/vidim.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
          <p class="description">
            You can download the latest stable version from <a href="https://github.com/OriginalEXE/vidim/tree/master/dist">here</a>
          </p>

          <p>or event better, npm install it:</p>
<pre><code>npm install vidim --save</code></pre>

          <h3 id="docs-new-instance">Creating a new instance</h3>
<pre><code>var myBackground = new vidim( '#element-id', {
  src: [
    {
      type: 'video/mp4',
      src: 'path/to/your/video.mp4'
    },
    {
      type: 'video/ogv',
      src: 'path/to/your/video.ogv'
    }
  ],
  poster: 'path/to/your/poster.jpg'
});</code></pre>

          <p class="description">
            Note: you can pass any valid CSS selector as a first argument, it
            doesn't have to be an id. It can also be a DOM element itself.
            For example, if you were using jQuery, you would pass
            <code>$( '.some-element' )[0]</code>
          </p>

          <p>or directly from the dom:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div style=&quot;padding-bottom: 65.25%;&quot; data-vidim=&quot;{ src: [{ type: &#39;video/mp4&#39;, src: &#39;path/to/your/video.mp4&#39;}]}&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

          <p class="description">
            Note: when using dom attribute, make sure you use no quotes on
            object keys and single quotes around strings.
          </p>

          <h3>Calling API methods on the instance</h3>
<pre><code>myBackground.play();
myBackground.pause();</code></pre>

          <h3>Listening for events</h3>
<pre><code>myBackground.on( 'pause', function() {
  console.log( 'Video paused!' );
});</code></pre>

          <h5>muted: true</h5>
          <p class="description">

          <h5>destroy()</h5>
          <p class="description">

           if the containing element could resize regardless of the browser
           video changing its size (for example inserting dynamic content),
           then you should call this manually to update the background video
           size.

          </p>

          <h5>vidim.getInstanceFromElement( element )</h5>
          <p class="description">
           Useful when you don't store the instance in a variable, but you need
           it to call some methods on it. You can use this method to retrieve
           the instance from the container you called it on. <code>element</code>
           can be either a selector string or an actual DOM element.
          </p>

          <h5>vidim.registerProvider( type, configuration )</h5>
          <p class="description">
           You can use this method to register another provider except the ones

           <code>src/providers</code> folder on GitHub for an example.
          </p>

          <h5>vidim.destroyAllInstances()</h5>
          <p class="description">
           If you want to destroy all active instances, you can use this simple
           method instead of calling <code>destroy()</code> on each instance
           separately.
          </p>

          <h5>vidim.scanDOM()</h5>
          <p class="description">
           Scans the DOM for any elements that have a <code>data-vidim</code>

          <p class="description">
           To listen for a specific event, call <code>.on( eventName, yourFunction )</code>
           on your vidim instance. To stop listening, call <code>.off( eventName, yourFunction )</code>.
           To listen for an event only once, use <code>.once( eventName, yourFunction )</code>,
           and to trigger an event, use <code>.emit( eventName )</code>.

          <h5>ready</h5>
          <p class="description">
           This event is emitted once the player is ready to receive API calls.

          <h5>play</h5>
          <p class="description">
           This event is emitted once the player starts playing (either
           initially or after a pause).
          </p>

          <h5>end</h5>
          <p class="description">
           Emitted once the video ends (will not be triggered if video is set to

           Emitted after the video has been resized (i.e. on every <code>resize()</code>
           method call).
          </p>

          <h5>canplay</h5>
          <p class="description">
           Self hosted video only. Emitted once the video has loaded enough to start
           playing, but not necessarily enough to play the whole duration without
           buffering.
          </p>

          <h5>canplaythrough</h5>
          <p class="description">
           Self hosted video only. Emitted once the video has loaded enough that it
